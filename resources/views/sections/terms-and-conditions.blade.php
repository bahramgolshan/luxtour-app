        1.2 These Terms of Use govern your relationship with us in respect of your use of the Services, including any

    <p>
        1.4 We may update or otherwise modify these Terms of Use at any time, and you understand and agree that your
        continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms of Use.
        We will note the date that updates were last made to the Terms of Use at the top of this page, and the updated
        Terms of Use will take effect upon posting. It is your responsibility to return to this page periodically to

    <p>

    <p>
        6.5 You alone are responsible for the User Content you submit. You assume all risks associated with such User
        Content, including anyone's reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness, or any disclosure by you of

        LuxTour
        has no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of your User Content, nor do we guarantee any
        confidentiality
        with respect to your User Content.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.8 Any use by you of the Interactive Areas or other portions of the Website in violation of the foregoing
        violates
        these Terms of Use and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the
        Interactive Areas and/or the Website. LuxTour may also suspend the processing of notices and complaints
        submitted

    <strong>
        Products and Booking Reservations
    </strong>
    <p>
        10.1. LuxTour provides the Platform through which you can enter into a contract with a third party supplier of a
        Product ("Supplier"). LuxTour is not a supplier of any Product, and your contract for supply of any Product you
        Book
        will be directly between you and the applicable Supplier.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.2. Suppliers may be businesses or consumers. If you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, and the Supplier
        you
        contract with is also a consumer, please note that you will not be able to enforce any consumer rights against
        that
        Supplier.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.3. In respect of each Booking, LuxTour acts as a disclosed agent on behalf of the Supplier, meaning that a
        Product listing represents an invitation to you to make an offer to a Supplier, and that we are free to accept
        or
        reject such offer on behalf of that Supplier. These Terms of Use govern your use of the Services, which includes
        your use of the Platform through which you may make such an offer to a Supplier. However, the provision of the
        Product you Book will be subject to the terms and conditions displayed on the Website in respect of such
        Product,
        any information made available to you during the Booking process, and the terms and conditions of the Supplier
        with
        whom you have a legal contract for the supply of the Product. If you have a question about a Product that is not
        answered in the information on the Website and where the answer to your question may influence whether you would
        like to proceed to Book (including but not limited to whether a Supplier is able to accept accompaniment by a
        pet or
        service animal), it is your responsibility to contact LuxTour prior to making a Booking and to obtain an answer
        to
        your question. Once you have made a Booking, you are subject to the cancellation policy as stated in the Product
        listing.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.4. If you make a Booking, you agree to review and be bound by the applicable Supplier's terms and conditions
        and
        any other rules or policies related to the Product (the "Supplier Terms"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
        extent that the Supplier Terms conflict with these Terms of Use in respect of your legal relationship with
        LuxTour,
        these Terms of Use shall prevail. Your interactions with Suppliers are at your own risk. LuxTour will have no
        liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of
        any
        Supplier or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your
        interactions with any Supplier.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.5 LuxTour is not a travel agency and does not provide or own any Experiences. Although LuxTour provides the
        Website with information about Products and facilitates Bookings, such actions do not in any way constitute
        LuxTour's sponsorship or approval of such Suppliers, or any affiliation between LuxTour and any Supplier.
        Although
        LuxTour Members may rate and review particular Products based on their own experiences, LuxTour does not endorse
        or
        recommend any Products. You agree that LuxTour is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of
        information it
        obtains from Suppliers and/or that is displayed on the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        10.6 By making a Booking, you warrant that you are at least 18 years of age, that you possess the legal
        authority to
        enter into both this binding agreement and a binding agreement with the Supplier, to use the Services, to
        purchase
        the Product, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the
        Platform to make only legitimate Bookings for you and/or others for whom you are legally authorized to act.
    </p>


    <strong>
        Pricing
    </strong>
    <p>11.1 The price of each Product will be quoted on a per-person basis, unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <p>
        11.2 Prices are based on the local tariff at the time of quoting, converted at the prevailing foreign-exchange
        rate
        as determined by LuxTour. See Section 12 for more information about currency conversions.
    </p>
    <p>11.3 Price quotations are subject to change without notice, until a Booking has been made.</p>
    <p>
        11.4 Unless the Supplier has otherwise specified, prices do not include any local taxes or use-fees, including
        foreign departure, security, port charges, park fees, customs, immigration, agricultural, passenger-facility
        charges
        or international transportation tax.
    </p>
    <p>
        11.5 Inclusions are determined by the Supplier. Prices do not include tips/gratuities; passport and visa fees;
        baggage and personal insurance; any items of a personal nature; taxes or duties; and any beverages or food not
        specifically stated as included by the Supplier.
    </p>

    <strong>
        Currency Conversions
    </strong>
    <p>
        12.1 If LuxTour provides a currency converter, currency rates are based on various publicly available sources
        and
        should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes may not be
        updated on a daily basis, and LuxTour and its affiliates do not warrant or guarantee accuracy. LuxTour shall not
        be
        liable to you if prices change due to currency fluctuations.
        Payments
    </p>
    <p>
        13.1 When you make a Booking, LuxTour or Owl Payments Limited will collect your payment information and will
        process
        your payment as described in Section 14. In doing so, LuxTour or Owl Payments Limited acts as the limited
        payment
        collection agent of the Supplier, collecting your payment for the applicable Product(s) on behalf of such
        Supplier.
        Full payment by credit or debit card is required to make a Booking, unless otherwise specified. The payee may be
        referenced as LuxTour/LuxTour/Owl Payments on your statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.2 The value of your Booking may be subject to taxes, duties, foreign transaction, currency exchange or other
        fees. Your bank or payment card company may convert the payment into the local currency and may charge fees,
        resulting in differences between the amount displayed through the Platform, and the final amount charged to you.
        LuxTour recommends that you contact your bank or card company if you have any questions concerning any
        applicable
        currency conversion or fees.
    </p>

    <strong>
        Payment Processing
    </strong>
    <p>
        14.1 Under these Terms of Use, the payment processing services for the Services provided are provided by LuxTour
        Limited, Owl Payments Limited, LuxTour, Inc., or LuxTour Systems Pty Limited. The registered office address of
        LuxTour Limited and Owl Payments Limited is 7 Soho Square, London W1D 3QB, UK. LuxTour Systems Pty Limited's
        registered office address is c/o Bird & Bird, Level 22, 25 Martin Place, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia. The
        principal
        place of business of LuxTour, Inc. is 400 1st Avenue, Needham, MA 02494, CANADA.
    </p>
    <p>
        14.2 If your payment was processed by LuxTour Limited, Owl Payments Limited, or LuxTour, Inc., the Terms of Use
        constitute an agreement between you and LuxTour, Inc. If your payment was processed by LuxTour Systems Pty
        Limited,
        the Terms of Use are an agreement between you and LuxTour Systems Pty Limited, and the Services are provided to
        you
        by LuxTour Systems Pty Limited. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use never constitute an agreement
        between
        you and LuxTour Limited, or you and Owl Payments Limited.
    </p>

    <strong>
        Modifications or Cancellations by You
    </strong>
    <p>
        15.1 Once a Product has been purchased, your Booking cannot be changed by you or cancelled with a refund, unless
        otherwise stated in the terms and conditions applicable to such Product. If you request that any element of your
        Booking is changed (including but not limited to your pick-up location or time), you acknowledge that it is
        entirely
        at the applicable Supplier’s discretion as to whether to accommodate your request. It is your responsibility to
        be
        at the meeting place at the time and date communicated on your Booking. In the case of certain Products, exact
        locations and times will be communicated to you after your Booking is made by the applicable Supplier via
        LuxTour’s
        messaging platform. It is your responsibility to check such messages after your Booking is made, and to be at
        the
        meeting place at the time and date that are communicated by the Supplier. If you are not at such meeting point
        at
        the required time, the Supplier may offer to accommodate you at an alternative time and date. However, the
        Supplier
        shall be under no obligation to do so, and your failure to be at the communicated meeting point at the required
        time
        may result in your Booking being classified as a “no show”, meaning that you will not be entitled to any refund
        or
        to being rebooked.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.2 The standard cancellation policy allows you to request a change to and/or cancel a Booking up until 24
        hours
        before the start time of the Booking; or if the Experience does not have an explicit start time, the deadline to
        request a change or to cancel will generally be 11:59pm, two days before the start date. Timings are calculated
        in
        accordance with the time zone of the Experience. For a cancellation to be effective, it must be made through the
        self-service options available through the Website (e.g. https://www.LuxTour.ca/account/bookings).
    </p>
    <p>
        15.3 If any Product is designated as 'All Sales Final' or with materially similar messaging (which includes but
        is
        not limited to all group bookings booked through our Group Bookings Department), it is non-refundable, and it
        will
        not be possible to change or cancel it after making a Booking. A minority of Products have other, different
        cancellation policies. In all circumstances, you must check the cancellation policy contained in the applicable
        Product listing at the time of your Booking, which is the policy that will apply to and govern the terms of your
        cancellation and any refunds.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.4 Notwithstanding Sections 15.2 and 15.3, (a) requests for modifications and amendments to a Booking,
        including
        date change requests (collectively, a "Change Request") must be made online through the 'Manage My Booking'
        section
        of the Website; and (b) if it is possible to implement a Change Request, LuxTour shall not charge a fee for
        doing
        so, as long as the Change Request is received by us by the deadline specified in the Product listing. Please
        note
        that a Supplier may charge a fee to accommodate a Change Request; in such circumstances, you will be required to
        pay
        such fee in order that LuxTour may successfully process your Change Request.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.5 All Change Requests shall be processed by LuxTour subject to the availability and agreement of the
        applicable
        Supplier. LuxTour does not guarantee the success of any Change Request, and it shall not be successful unless
        LuxTour confirms that a Change Request is accepted. To the extent the Supplier is unwilling or unable to accept
        such
        Change Request, then your right to a refund (if any) shall be governed by the cancellation terms of your
        Booking. It
        is your responsibility to cancel a Booking before any deadline to cancel with a refund, even if you are waiting
        for
        a Supplier’s response to a Change Request.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.6 If you make a Booking using a promotion code, or if you accept a discount or special-offer price during the
        check-out process, you may invalidate your discount or special-offer price by making a Change Request after
        Booking.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.7 No refunds are available once an Experience has commenced, or in respect of any Product's package,
        accommodation, meals or any other services that have started to be utilized.
    </p>

    <strong>
        Other Modifications and Cancellations
    </strong>
    <p>
        16.1 Occasionally a Supplier may make a change to a Product after your purchase, including but not limited to
        the
        date, price, inclusions, coverage, age requirements, and/or any other Product features and/or requirements. As a
        result, LuxTour (acting on the Supplier’s behalf), reserves the right to cancel, change or substitute any
        Product
        that you have purchased, at any time, for any reason. If the change proposed by the Supplier is material (for
        example, a change in dates and/or a significant change to the itinerary), and you are dissatisfied with the
        alternative that is offered, you will be entitled to a full refund of the original purchase price.
    </p>
    <p>
        16.2 We may decide, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable for the protection of our
        interests,
        the Supplier's interests and/or your interests, to withdraw our Services resulting in an override of the
        Product's
        cancellation policy and the effective cancellation of a Booking. We may also determine, in our sole discretion,
        to
        arrange refund to you part or all of the amounts charged to you. You agree that we and the applicable Supplier
        shall
        have no liability for such cancellations or refunds.
    </p>

    <strong>
        Passports, Visas & Insurance
    </strong>
    <p>
        17.1 When you make a Booking, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and
        that
        your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.
    </p>
    <p>
        17.2 For applicable passport and visa requirements, you should consult the relevant embassy or consulate for
        information. Such requirements may change at any time, and it is your responsibility to check for up-to-date
        information before making a Booking and before your departure. LuxTour accepts no liability in connection with
        any
        person who is refused entry onto a flight or into any country, including countries such person may just be
        passing
        through en route to their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        17.3 As visa and health requirements are subject to change without notice, LuxTour recommends that you verify
        health
        and visa requirements with the appropriate consulate prior to departure. It is also your responsibility to
        consult
        your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that
        you
        meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.
    </p>
    <p>17.4 LuxTour strongly recommends that you purchase a comprehensive travel insurance policy prior to departure to
        protect your Product purchase. If you cancel your trip or significantly alter travel dates, your travel
        insurance
        policy may reimburse the cost of cancellation fees and related expenses. Please review your travel insurance
        policy
        carefully for related terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>17.5 Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel
        to
        certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. LuxTour urges customers to investigate and review
        travel
        prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government and destination
        country
        governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information on conditions in various
        countries
        and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations can be found at
        www.state.gov,
        www.tsa.gov, www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac, and www.customs.gov.
    </p>
    <p>17.6 LUXTOUR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO ANY DESTINATION IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND
        LUXTOUR
        IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.
        Our Liability

    <p>18.2 THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, SOFTWARE, PLATFORM, AND SERVICES PUBLISHED ON OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED VIA THE

        (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRICING, AVAILABILITY, PHOTOGRAPHS, FEATURES, INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS,
        GENERAL
        PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS, REVIEWS AND RATINGS, ETC.). IN ADDITION, LUXTOUR EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CORRECT
        ANY
        AVAILABILITY AND OBVIOUS PRICING ERRORS AND/OR ON BOOKINGS MADE UNDER AN OBVIOUSLY INCORRECT PRICE.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>18.3 THE LUXTOUR GROUP COMPANIES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE INFORMATION, CONTENT,
        SOFTWARE, PLATFORM, PRODUCTS, AND OTHER SERVICES FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND THE INCLUSION OR OFFERING OF ANY PRODUCTS

        DISCLAIMS
        ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH REGARD TO THIS INFORMATION, CONTENT, SOFTWARE, PLATFORM, PRODUCTS, AND

        INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>18.4 THE SUPPLIERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES OF ANY OF THE LUXTOUR GROUP COMPANIES.
        THE LUXTOUR GROUP COMPANIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THE ACTS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
        BREACHES,
        NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT OF ANY SUCH SUPPLIERS OR FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR OTHER
        DAMAGES
        OR EXPENSES RESULTING THEREFROM OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM ANY BOOKING OR USE OF A PRODUCT. THE LUXTOUR GROUP

        STRIKE,
        FORCE MAJEURE OR OTHER CAUSES BEYOND THEIR DIRECT CONTROL, AND THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL
        EXPENSE, OMISSIONS, DELAYS, RE-ROUTING OR ACTS OF ANY GOVERNMENT OR AUTHORITY.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>18.5 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LUXTOUR GROUP COMPANIES (OR ANY OF THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE
        FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
        LIMITATION LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION OR COSTS TO PROCURE SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN
        ANY
        WAY CONNECTED WITH, A PRODUCT OR A BOOKING, OR YOUR ACCESS TO, DISPLAY OF OR USE OF THE SERVICES WHETHER BASED
        ON A
        THEORY OF NEGLIGENCE, CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF LUXTOUR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
        THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>18.6 If any LuxTour Group Company is found liable for any loss or damage that arises out of or is in any way
        connected with your use of the Services or with a Booking or use of a Product, then the LuxTour Group Companies'
        liabilities will in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of (a) the sum paid to LuxTour in respect of
        the
        Booking giving rise to the claim, or (b) one hundred dollars (US $100.00).
    </p>
    <p>18.7 The limitation of liability set forth in this Section 18 reflects the allocation of risk between the
        parties.
        The limitations specified in this Section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these
        Terms
        of Use is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these Terms of
        Use
        inure to the benefit of the LuxTour Group Companies.
    </p>
    <p>18.8 These Terms of Use and the foregoing liability disclaimer do not affect mandatory legal rights that cannot
        be
        excluded under applicable law, for example, under consumer protection laws in place in certain countries. In the
        UK
        and EU, this includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our
        employees, agents or subcontractors, and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. If you are a consumer in the
        UK
        or the EU, this Agreement does not exclude any liability for losses and damages caused by a breach of any duty
        to
        act with reasonable care and skill or by a breach of this Agreement, provided that the resulting damages were
        foreseeable when the obligations arose.</p>

    <strong>
        Your Liability
    </strong>
    <p>This Section 19 (Indemnification) does not apply to consumers who are resident in the UK or EU.</p>
    <p>

    <strong>
        Worry-free Shore Excursions
    </strong>
    <p>20.1 For Products noted as a "Worry-free Shore Excursion", if you (a) purchase such a Product for redemption
        while
        in a particular port-of-call, and (b) are not returned by the applicable Supplier to the ship in time to board,
        LuxTour will (subject to Sections 20.2 and 20.3) arrange the necessary transport to the next port-of-call.
    </p>
    <p>20.2 The policy set forth in this Section 20.1 - 20.4 applies only when, through no fault or action of your own,
        you
        are not returned to the ship in time to board. The policy is void in instances where delay is caused by your own
        actions and/or you have deviated from the Experience that you Booked.
    </p>
    <p>20.3 In order to benefit from this policy, you must supply LuxTour with correct arrival and departure ship
        information and ensure there is enough time (minimum 2 hours) between the Experience end time and the ship
        departure
        time. You must contact LuxTour directly and as soon as possible to request next port-of-call transportation
        arrangements as you cannot book your own travel without voiding this policy.
    </p>
    <p>20.4 Subject to your eligibility, LuxTour will facilitate the booking of travel for you to the next port of call
        (not to exceed US$1,000 per person).
    </p>
    <p>20.5 In addition to the protection offered pursuant to Section 20.1 - 20.4, if your ship misses a port-of-call or
        is
        delayed beyond the commencement time of your Worry-free Shore Excursion, simply contact LuxTour within 14 days.
        Pending verification of the ship's actual itinerary, we will issue you a refund.</p>

    <strong>
        LuxTour Tickets
    </strong>
    <p>
        21.1 You will receive a LuxTour-branded ticket (or, alternatively a voucher from the Supplier) (in each case, a
        "Ticket") for each Product you you Book, with such Ticket being issued on behalf of the applicable Supplier. In
        order to access and print your Ticket, you will be directed to a secure webpage hosted by LuxTour that contains
        a
        link to your Ticket. Certain Bookings will result in your being provided with an electronic Ticket as well as or
        instead of a paper Ticket.
    </p>
    <p>21.2 You must provide the original, authentic Ticket to the applicable Supplier in order to redeem your Product.
        Your Booking cannot be honored or redeemed without presenting a valid Ticket. Ensure you read the terms and
        conditions relating to your Booking in order to understand what will be required by the Supplier by way of
        Ticket
        presentation.
    </p>
    <p>21.3 For security purposes, when redeeming your Ticket you must present a valid photo ID and sign the Ticket.
    </p>
    <p>21.4 In some cases, a Supplier may also require that you present the payment card used to purchase your Product
        at
        the time of redemption. This typically applies to attraction and show tickets. You should be advised at
        check-out
        whether or not this will be required. If you have questions about such a requirement, contact LuxTour's
        Customer.</p>

        22. Updates to these Terms of Use; Modifications; Termination and Withdrawal
    </p>
    <p>22.1 Terms of Use: LuxTour may change, add or delete these terms and conditions of these Terms of Use or any
        portion
        thereof from time to time in its sole discretion (or in its reasonable discretion for consumers resident in the
        UK
        or EU) where we deem it necessary for legal, general regulatory and technical purposes, or due to changes in the
        Services provided or nature or layout of Services. Thereafter, you expressly agree to be bound by the terms and
        conditions of these Terms of Use as amended.
    </p>
    <p>22.2 Modifications: LuxTour may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including
        availability of any of the Services’ features, databases or User Content, at any time, without any cost to you,
        including: (a) to ensure compliance with applicable laws and/or reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory
        requirements, such as mandatory consumer laws; (b) to perform temporary maintenance, fix bugs, implement
        technical
        adjustments, for operational purposes or make improvements, such as adapting the Services to a new technical
        environment, transferring the Services to a new hosting platform, or ensuring Service compatibility with the
        devices
        and software (as updated from time to time); (c) to upgrade or amend the Services, including releasing new
        versions
        of the websites on certain devices or otherwise amending or making modifications to existing features and
        functionality; (d) to alter the structure, design or layout of the Services, including changing the name of or
        re-branding the Services, or amending, improving and/or expanding the features and functionalities available;
        and
        (e) for security reasons.
    </p>
    <p>For UK and EU-based users: If we make any changes to the Services which we reasonably consider will materially
        negatively impact your access to or use of the Services, we will give you reasonable notice of the changes. If
        you
        do not terminate your contract with us before these changes take place, we will take that as your acceptance of
        the
        changes. 22.3 Updates: We may make updates to keep the Services in conformity with applicable consumer laws. If
        automatic updates are switched on in your settings, we will automatically update the Services. You can change
        your
        settings at any time if you prefer to no longer receive automatic updates.
    </p>
    <p>To get the best experience and to ensure the Services operate correctly, we recommend that you accept any updates
        to
        the Services that we inform you about as and when they become available. This may also require you to update
        your
        device operating system. As and when new operating systems and devices are released, we may over time stop
        supporting older versions. If you choose not to download or install any updates, the Services may no longer be
        available, supported, or have previous functionality.
    </p>
    <p>We are not responsible for your failure to download or install any update or the most recent published version of
        the Services in order to benefit from new or improved features and/or functionality and/or meet compatibility
        requirements where we have informed you about the update, explained the consequences of failing to install it
        and
        provided installation instructions. Any changes to the Service not in accordance with this "Updates" provision
        will
        be subject to the "Modifications" section above.
    </p>
    <p>22.4 Termination: LuxTour may also impose limits or otherwise restrict your access to all or parts of the
        Services
        without notice or liability for technical or security reasons, to prevent against unauthorized access, loss of,
        or
        destruction of data or where LuxTour considers in its sole discretion (or in its reasonable discretion for
        consumers
        resident in the UK or EU) that you are in breach of any provision of this Agreement or of any law or regulation
        and
        where LuxTour decides to discontinue providing any aspect of the Services.
        LuxTour may terminate this Agreement with you at any time, without advanced notice, where it believes in good
        faith
        that you have breached this Agreement or otherwise believes that termination is reasonably necessary to
        safeguard
        the rights of LuxTour and/or others users of the Services. That means that we may stop providing you with
        Services.
    </p>

    <strong>

    </p>
    <p>23.2 LuxTour's performance of these Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
        contained in these Terms of Use limits LuxTour's right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or
        legal
        requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by LuxTour
        with
        respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause
        of
        action arising from or relating to your access or use of the Services within two (2) years from the date on

        such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.
    </p>
    <p>23.3 If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
        including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
        invalid
        or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches

    </p>
    <p>23.4 These Terms of Use (and any other terms and conditions referenced herein) constitute the entire agreement
        between you and LuxTour with respect to the Services and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
        communications
        and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and LuxTour with respect to the Services. A
        printed
        version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
        administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the
        same
        conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

        arising from or relating to the Services must be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter
        jurisdiction located in Boston, Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>24.2 Use of the Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these
        terms and conditions, including, without limitation, this paragraph. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent
